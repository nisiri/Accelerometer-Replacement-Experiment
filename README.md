# Accelerometer Replacement Experiment

The purpose of this experiment is to compare the calibration data of two sets of accelerometers by using a "FEEL Algorithm" to test for localization accuracy and force estimates

This repository is a branch of a bigger master repository with more private result folder, gitmodules and python files that supported this experiment
